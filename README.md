What Do I Want To Make?

A web app where users can track their movie watching habits. Users can create an account or log in, search for movies and filter movies based on genre, year, ratings etc. They can also rate and review movies, as well as add movies to their personal watch list.

How many branches and what for?

Main Branch

- This is my production-ready branch. It should always contain stable, tested code

Back end

Front End

Landing-Page Branch

- Where I set up the user landing page and the ability for the user to create an account or log in

- Users can also select an avatar image here to suit their movie personality

Card-List Branch

- Where I set up the homepage and the inital card list that pulls the list of movies from my backend API

Feature/Filter Branch

- Branch where I create the ability to search and filter each film based on the movie genre, year or rating.
- This is also where I create the ability to have each movie link to a specific film trailer

Rate/Review Branch

- This is where I set up the clickable movie page/popup where the user can rate, review and add the movie to their watchlist

Watchlist branch

- This is the branch where I set up the user watchlist page that displays their saved movies

Styling Branch

- Branch where I style and make everything look aesthetically pleasing

Dark mode branch

- Where I will add the ablility to switch to darkmode

# Styling Goals

I want the site to have a minimal, clean feel, some references are MUBI and Letterboxd.

Here are a few styling features Iâ€™d like to implement:

- Interesting Font
- Icons (icons for pages like homepage, watchlist, dark mode switch)
- Resizing card/images so everything is uniform, clean layout
