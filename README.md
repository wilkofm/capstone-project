# Project Outline

What Do I Want To Make?

CineMax is a web app where users can track their movie watching habits. Users can create an account or log in, search for movies and add them to their personal watchlist. They can also rate and review movies, as well as read other users reviews.

Here are some screenshots of the project:

# Styling Goals

I want the site to have a minimal, clean feel, some references are MUBI, IMDb and Letterboxd.

Here are a few styling features Iâ€™d like to implement:

- Tailwind CSS to style the page
- Clean layout
- A CineMax logo implemented across pages
- Icons
- A nav-bar to house the filter options
- Resizing card/images so everything is uniform
