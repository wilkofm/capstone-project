What Do I Want To Make?

CineMax is a web app where users can track their movie watching habits. Users can create an account or log in, search for movies and filter movies based on genre, year, ratings etc. They can also rate and review movies, as well as add movies to their personal watch list.

Here are a few styling features Iâ€™d like to implement:

- Dedicated Font
- A nav-bar to house the filter options
- Resizing card/images so everything is uniform
